## Experience

### 2018 ‣ Now ∙ Research Fellow ∙ CoAx Lab, CMU
- Game theory, dynamical systems, neuro- and bio-inspired artificial intelligence.

### 2017 ‣ 2018 ∙ Senior Research Scientist ∙ Kernel.co, Los Angeles CA 
- Technical lead. Developed *real-time* system for complex spatio-temporal voltage field shaping in deep brain stimulation. 

### 2015 ‣ 2017 ∙ Postdoctoral Fellow ∙ Voytek Lab, U.C. San Diego
- Developed novel theoretical accounts, biophysical modeling approaches, to understand the role of neural oscillations in human cognition. Advised and developed machine-learning analysis of spectral and time-series data.

### 2014 ‣ 2015 ∙ Postdoctoral Fellow ∙ Wheeler Lab, University of Pittsburgh
- Theoretical and empirical analysis of human decision making. Machine learning analysis of high-dimensional (fMRI) data.

### 2006 ‣ 2012 ∙ Graduate Research Assistant ∙ Seger Lab, Colorado State University
- Completed PhD on human reinforcement learning, and category learning. Authored several (at the time) state-of-the-art libraries for machine learning analysis of fMRI data.

### 2004 ‣ 2006 ∙ Research Assistant II ∙ Biosearch Technologies, Novato CA
